### Main Features
- Supply and borrow WETH/USDC
- Repay borrowed positions
- Withdraw supplied assets
- Query maximum withdrawal amounts
- Manage lending positions

### Supported Networks
- Base Mainnet

## Common Tasks

1. Supply Operations
   - "Supply 5 WETH to Ionic protocol"
   - "Deposit 10000 USDC as collateral in Ionic"
   - "Add WETH liquidity to Ionic lending pool"

2. Borrow Operations
   - "Borrow 1000 USDC from Ionic using my WETH as collateral"
   - "Take out a 2 WETH loan from Ionic"
   - "Get a USDC loan against my supplied ETH"

3. Repayment Operations
   - "Repay 500 USDC to my Ionic loan"
   - "Pay back 1 WETH to Ionic protocol"
   - "Close my USDC debt position in Ionic"

4. Withdrawal Operations
   - "Withdraw 2 WETH from my Ionic supply position"
   - "Remove 5000 USDC from Ionic protocol"
   - "Check how much WETH I can withdraw from Ionic"
   - "Calculate my maximum USDC withdrawal amount"

5. Position Information
   - "Show my current WETH supply in Ionic"
   - "Check my USDC borrow balance"
   - "View my collateral ratio in Ionic"
   - "Get current borrowing rates for WETH"
