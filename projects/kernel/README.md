# KernelDAO

Integration with KernelDAO


## Overview

KernelDAO is a restaking protocol that reimagines cryptoeconomic security. 
At its core, Kernel allows BNB token holders to amplify the utility of their assets through a restaking mechanism. 
Users can contribute to the security of multiple services simultaneously, creating a robust, shared security framework.

## Features

Key functions of KernelDAO:
- Stake and unstake supported assets for BTC and BNB
- Gain points for future $KERNEL rewards

## Supported Networks

- BSC

## Common Tasks

1. Basic Operations
   - "Stake 5 BNB in Kernel"
   - "Stake 0.1 0xf6718b2701D4a6498eF77D7c152b2137Ab28b8A3 tokens in Kernel"
   - "Stake 0.034 pumpBTC in Kernel"
   - "Unstake 1 BNB from Kernel"
   - "Unstake 0.02 0x1bdd3Cf7F79cfB8EdbB955f20ad99211551BA275 tokens from Kernel"
   - "Unstake 35 slisBNB from Kernel"

2. Information Queries
   - "Show current points for BNBX in Kernel"
   - "Check my points in Kernel"
   - "Check 0xffdd45f075e5f757e86bb83fca7114bed9914166 points in Kernel"
   - "Show current TVL"


## Addressing Pain Points

- Staking liquid staking tokens (LSTs) for BNB and BTC to help secure the chain and earn rewards

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @heyanon/kernel
```
