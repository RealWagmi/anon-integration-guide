## Future

- Trailing stop support in OCO orders
- TWAP orders
- OTOCO orders to do stuff like "Buy 1 BTC/USDT, then place a 10% take profit and a 15% stop loss" in a single go, avoiding potential issues with price changes and fund unavailability
- OTO orders to do stuff like "Buy 1 BTC/USDT, then place a 15% stop loss" in single go, avoiding potential issues with price changes and fund unavailability
- Spot with margin
- Implement open orders pagination
- More meaningful error messages, using the [exchange's `exceptions` property](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/ts/src/binance.ts#L1550), for example:
    - `{"code":-1013,"msg":"Filter failure: NOTIONAL"}` should be "Order too small for this market"
    - API key errors such as [this one](https://d.pr/i/bKUK9j)
- In order output, include amount spent/received in quote currency
