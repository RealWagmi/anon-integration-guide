# Lido Protocol - Liquid Staking for Ethereum

## Overview

Lido is a decentralized liquid staking protocol designed for Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH while retaining liquidity. By staking ETH on Lido, users receive stETH (a liquid staking token) in return, which can be used in other DeFi protocols while still earning staking rewards. This combination of staking rewards and liquidity sets Lido apart from traditional staking models.

### Main Features

- **Liquid Staking**: Stake ETH and receive stETH, enabling liquidity while earning staking rewards.
- **Decentralized**: Built on a decentralized network of validators ensuring security and reliability.
- **Real-time Rewards**: Earn staking rewards in real-time.
- **Seamless DeFi Integration**: Use stETH in other DeFi protocols while continuing to earn staking rewards.
- **No Minimum Staking Amount**: Stake any amount of ETH without limitations.
- **Principal Protection**: Staked assets are secured through decentralized validators.

### Supported Networks

- **Ethereum**: Stake ETH and receive stETH, which can be used for liquidity and other DeFi strategies.

## Common Tasks

### 1. Deposits

- "Stake 1 ETH and receive stETH on Ethereum"
- "Deposit 10 ETH to Lido’s staking protocol on Ethereum"
- "Stake 0.5 ETH and get stETH on Ethereum"

### 2. Withdrawals

- "Withdraw 2 stETH from my staking position on Ethereum"
- "Unstake 5 ETH and receive stETH on Ethereum"
- "Withdraw stETH from Lido staking pool on Ethereum"

### 3. Information Queries

- "Show my current staking position in Lido on Ethereum"
- "Check my stETH balance on Ethereum"
- "Get the current staking rewards rate for Lido on Ethereum"
- "Display staking details for my Ethereum position in Lido"
- "Check my current staking rewards from Lido on Ethereum"

### 4. Analysis & Tracking

- "Track the performance of my stETH holdings on Ethereum"
- "Calculate expected staking rewards with 5 ETH in Lido"
- "Monitor staking yield from Lido protocol on Ethereum"

## Pain Points Solved

1. **Liquidity in Staking**: Stake ETH while retaining liquidity with stETH tokens.
2. **No Staking Lock-in**: Earn staking rewards without locking ETH in a traditional staking contract.
3. **Seamless DeFi Integration**: Use stETH in decentralized finance applications while earning rewards.
4. **Simplified Staking**: Stake and withdraw without complex processes or minimum amounts.

## Why Liquid Staking with Lido?
