# **Lido Protocol - Liquid Staking for Ethereum**

## **Overview**

Lido is a decentralized liquid staking protocol for Ethereum, enabling users to stake ETH while maintaining liquidity. By staking ETH through Lido, users receive **stETH** (a liquid staking token) in return. stETH can be utilized in other DeFi protocols while simultaneously earning staking rewards, offering a unique blend of liquidity and yield generation compared to traditional staking models.

### **Main Features**

- **Liquid Staking**: Stake ETH and receive stETH, allowing liquidity while earning staking rewards.
- **Decentralized**: Secured by a decentralized network of validators for robust security and reliability.
- **Real-time Rewards**: Accrue staking rewards in real-time without manual claim processes.
- **DeFi Integration**: Utilize stETH across multiple DeFi protocols while continuously earning staking rewards.
- **No Minimum Staking Amount**: Stake any amount of ETH, even fractions, without limitations.
- **Principal Protection**: Safeguard staked assets through a decentralized validator ecosystem.

## **Supported Networks**

### **Ethereum**

- Stake ETH and receive stETH for liquidity and DeFi strategies.

## **Common Tasks**

### **1. Deposits**

- Stake 1 ETH and receive stETH on Ethereum
- Deposit 10 ETH to Lido’s staking protocol on Ethereum
- Stake 0.5 ETH and get stETH on Ethereum

### **2. Withdrawals**

- Withdraw 2 stETH from my staking position on Ethereum
- Unstake 5 ETH and receive stETH on Ethereum
- Withdraw stETH from Lido staking pool on Ethereum

### **3. Information Queries**

- Show my current staking position in Lido on Ethereum
- Check my stETH balance on Ethereum
- Get the current staking rewards rate for Lido on Ethereum
- Display staking details for my Ethereum position in Lido
- Check my current staking rewards from Lido on Ethereum

### **4. Analysis & Tracking**

- Track the performance of my stETH holdings on Ethereum
- Calculate expected staking rewards with 5 ETH in Lido
- Monitor staking yield from Lido protocol on Ethereum

## **Pain Points Solved**

1.  **Liquidity in Staking**: Stake ETH while retaining liquidity with stETH tokens.
2.  **No Staking Lock-in**: Earn staking rewards without locking ETH in a traditional staking contract.
3.  **Seamless DeFi Integration**: Use stETH in decentralized finance applications while earning rewards.
4.  **Simplified Staking**: Stake and withdraw without complex processes or minimum amounts.
